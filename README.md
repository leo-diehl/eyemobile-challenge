# React Development Technical Challenge

## Approach used:

Even coding for a limited scope of two screens, I built the
components and planned the file's structure as this would be the
basis of a big development project.
Due to my restricted time of 3 days, I decided to not code
unit testing for the components.

## Note:

I modified the given mockup cashflow file to allow the user to use all the
date-range buttons.
